3. **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).

4. **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior. If you're not sure if the behavior you're seeing is a bug, please include the problem in the description anyway and mark the issue as a question.
