# Valhalla core

Valhalla is a API for the [Valhalla](https://github.com/akrck02/valhalla) modern productivity app.

# API vs Monolith structure

Valhalla relies on a microservice architecture, which means that the API is separated from the core. This allows for a more flexible and scalable architecture, as well as a better separation of concerns.
